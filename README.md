Babel is an exercise to understand expressive type systems. The goal is to
build a call by value programming language which does not require runtime
support

### Design goals
 - Keep the language/compiler simple
 - Keep semantics clear

### Features
 - [ ] static typing
 - [ ] C based ABI
 - [ ] C interoperability
 - [ ] parametric polymorphism
 - [ ] type classes
 - [ ] affine types
 - [ ] references
 - [ ] pattern matching
 - [ ] functors
 - [ ] metaprgramming
